### Today's Topics

<div class="simple-box">

* Let's observe a simulation of the Kuramoto model recreating "firefly flashing"

## Overview of the Kuramoto Model

---

### The Kuramoto Model

<div class="simple-box">

* The Kuramoto model is a mathematical model for describing phenomena where "rhythms synchronize"
* It was proposed by Dr. Yoshiki Kuramoto in 1975
* Let's watch a video of metronomes synchronizing!

</div>

### Applications of the Kuramoto Model

<div class="simple-box">

* It can model "rhythm synchronization phenomena"!
  * üëè Applause rhythms
  * Firefly illumination rhythms
  * Power grids (when generator frequencies get out of sync, blackouts occur!)
  * Heartbeat rhythms (disruption leads to atrial fibrillation)

</div>

---

### The Kuramoto Model Equation

$$ \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) $$

<div class="simple-box">

* $\theta_i$ is the phase of oscillator $i$
* $\omega_i$ is the angular velocity of oscillator $i$
* $K$ is the strength of interaction (coupling constant)
* $N$ is the number of oscillators

</div>

---

### The Second Term

$$ \frac{K}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) $$

<div class="simple-box">

* Think of $\theta_i$ as your applause rhythm and $\theta_j$ as other people's applause rhythms
* This term represents the average deviation between your rhythm and everyone else's
* The larger the coupling constant $K$, the easier it is for rhythms to synchronize

</div>

---

### Meaning of the Coupling Constant $K$

<div class="simple-box">

* The larger the coupling constant $K$, the easier it is for rhythms to synchronize
  * When $K$ is small, rhythms don't synchronize
* In the applause example, $K$ represents how much you're consciously trying to match your applause to others
  * When $K=0$, you're not paying attention to others' applause at all and maintaining your own rhythm
* Let's see examples of this in simulation later!

</div>

---

### Revisiting the Kuramoto Model Equation

$$ \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) $$

<div class="simple-box">

* The "rate of change of your rhythm" is determined by the "average deviation from others' rhythms" and coupling constant $K$

</div>

---

## Simulation of the Kuramoto Model

---

### Simulating the Kuramoto Model

<div class="simple-box">

* Someone shared Kuramoto model simulation code on GitHub, so I modified their code to play around with it!
  * https://github.com/fabridamicelli/kuramoto
* Let's use this code to observe how firefly flashing rhythms synchronize!

</div>

---

### Firefly Flashing: $K=2$

<div class="simple-box">

* Rhythms gradually synchronize over time!

</div>

<img src="assets/images/firefly-K=2.png" width="55%">

---

### Firefly Flashing: $K=5$

<div class="simple-box">

* With a larger coupling constant, rhythms synchronize quickly!

</div>

<img src="assets/images/firefly-K=5.png" width="55%">

---

### Firefly Flashing: $K=0$

<div class="simple-box">

* When the coupling constant is 0, rhythms never synchronize!

</div>

<img src="assets/images/firefly-K=0.png" width="50%">

---

### The Mysterious Behavior of the Coupling Constant

<div class="simple-box">

* When $K=1.59$, rhythms don't synchronize
* When $K=1.6$, rhythms synchronize (though it takes time)

</div>

## The Kuramoto Conjecture and Phase Transitions

---

### The Kuramoto Conjecture

<div class="simple-box">

* When the coupling constant exceeds the critical point $K_c$, rhythms suddenly begin to synchronize
* It's like water suddenly turning to ice at 0¬∞C

</div>

The critical point $K_c$ is:

$$ K_c = \dfrac{2}{\pi g(0)} $$

* $g(\omega)$ is the distribution function of angular velocities
* $g(0)$ is the distribution function when $\omega=0$

---

### Calculating the Critical Point

<div class="simple-box">

* In our simulation, the angular velocity distribution function $g(\omega)$ is the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$

</div>

$$ g(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{\omega^2}{2}} $$

---

### Mean Field Frequency

<div class="simple-box">

* The average angular velocity of all oscillators becomes 0
* This average angular velocity is called the "mean field frequency"
* The entire system's distribution can be represented by $g(0)$

</div>

$$ g(0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} $$

---

### Calculating the Critical Point

$$ K_c = \dfrac{2}{\pi g(0)} = \dfrac{2}{\pi \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{8}{\pi}} \simeq 1.596 $$

<div class="simple-box">

* $K=1.6$ barely exceeds the critical point, so rhythms synchronize!
* This phenomenon, where properties change dramatically beyond a critical point, is called a "**phase transition**"

</div>

---

### Examples of Phase Transitions

<div class="simple-box">

* Phase transitions appear in various physical phenomena
  * Water turning to ice at 0¬∞C
  * Water evaporating at 100¬∞C
  * Magnets losing magnetism at high temperatures
  * Vacuum phase transitions (the beginning of the universe)

</div>

---

### Proof of the Kuramoto Conjecture

<div class="simple-box">

* The Kuramoto model was proposed in 1975, and the Kuramoto conjecture was formulated in 1984
* The Kuramoto conjecture was proven in 2012 by Dr. Hayato Chiba, who was at Kyushu University at the time!
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0249
* Therefore, it should now be called the "Kuramoto-Chiba Theorem"

</div>

---

### Summary

<div class="simple-box">

* The Kuramoto model can explain phenomena where "rhythms synchronize"
* The coupling constant represents the tendency to adjust to deviations from surrounding rhythms
* When the coupling constant exceeds the critical point, rhythms suddenly synchronize (Kuramoto conjecture, proven in 2012)
* The Kuramoto model is a representative model of phase transition phenomena

### Call for Lightning Talk Presenters

<div class="simple-box">

* The Physics Study Group is looking for lightning talk presenters!
  * Any genre is welcome!
  * If no one volunteers, the organizer will have to do another "lightning talk" that's actually a giant recital...
* If you're interested, please join the Physics Study Group Discord server!

</div>

### Announcements

<div class="simple-box">

* The next meeting is scheduled for June 28th
* In addition to lightning talks, we also welcome suggestions for physics YouTube videos that you'd like to watch together with everyone!
